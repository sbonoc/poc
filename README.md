# Personal PoCs & Playground

This repository serves as a personal collection of Proof of Concepts (PoCs) and hands-on explorations into various new frameworks, libraries, and architectural patterns. Each sub-project demonstrates a specific technology or solution, providing practical examples and insights.

Feel free to explore the individual project directories for more detailed information and setup instructions.

*   **Spring Boot Cache with Redis (`spring-boot-cache-redis`)**: Demonstrates a caching strategy using Spring Boot's local cache combined with Spring Data Redis as a central cache.
